# Direction of transition (top, right, bottom, left) e.g: "right" direction will make
# all windows come from right to left

# (smart-x, smart-y) are smart direction that will check if there are 
# multiple windows that splits the screen and will change their directions,
# in "smart-x" it changes direction of left window to "right" and direction of 
# right window to "left", if screen is not splited and a window is taking 
# a lot of screen it will change that window direction to "left".
# "smart-y" is also exactly like "smart-x" but instead of translating directions to
# "right" and "left", it translate to "top" and "bottom"

# Function that calculates new position of window (defaults to "ease-out-cubic")

# naming conventions are different to that site tho, e.g "easeInSine" is listed
# on site but here that translated to "ease-in-sine"

# Similar to opacity rules but determites transition direction e.g:
# "right: name *= 'Firefox'" will make firefox transition direction to right
# Specify a list of transition rules, in the format `DIRECTION:PATTERN`

# for disabling transition on specific patterns use "none" keyword as a direction
# e.g: use "none: window_type = 'popup_menu'" for disabling transitions on popup menus
